# Image-classifier-2-categories

This is a small image classifier model which classifies two images using a 2D convolutional layer. I have used this to classify dogs and cats but the accuracy and loss are way off and it overfits the data.

I have used this dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog which is pretty organised and I have separated this dataset and taken training-set to a different folder named data and the test-set as testset.
